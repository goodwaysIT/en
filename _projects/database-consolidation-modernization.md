title: "Enterprise Database Consolidation: Driving Cost Efficiency and Green IT with ODA X8-2 & Oracle 19c"
description: "This case study details how we consolidated 16 standalone Oracle databases onto two Oracle ODA X8-2 appliances using the Oracle 19c multitenant architecture, helping a client optimize data center space, reduce Oracle licensing costs, and lower carbon emissions."
excerpt: "Facing rising IT costs and environmental pressures, we engineered a comprehensive database consolidation. The project involved migrating 16 databases to two high-performance, all-flash ODA X8-2 appliances using Oracle 19c multitenant technology. This move optimized data center space, reduced the carbon footprint, slashed Oracle license fees, and established a modern, efficient, and green data platform."

### Customer Background

A large enterprise's data center was running dozens of critical business applications, supported by 16 individual Oracle databases. As the business grew, this fragmented database architecture presented numerous challenges: a large footprint of physical servers led to strained data center space and high power and cooling costs. Furthermore, maintaining separate Oracle licenses for each database created a significant financial burden. The client urgently sought a modern solution to address these pressing issues.

### Core Challenges

The client's objectives were clear: optimize IT infrastructure, achieve significant cost savings, and align with the company's green and sustainable development strategy. The main challenges of the project were:

- **Infrastructure Sprawl:** 16 databases were scattered across multiple aging servers, complicating management and consuming valuable data center space and power resources.
- **High Operational Costs:** A combination of expensive Oracle license fees, hardware maintenance costs, and rising electricity bills constituted a heavy IT operational burden.
- **Migration Risk & Business Continuity:** Safely and smoothly migrating 16 production databases to a new platform without impacting online services was a critical and complex challenge.
- **Future-Proofing:** The new platform needed not only to solve current problems but also to offer robust performance and scalability to support business growth for years to come.

### Goodways' Solution and Value

As the client's trusted technology partner, Goodways delivered an end-to-end service, from solution assessment and architectural design to migration and implementation.

1.  **Comprehensive Assessment and Planning:**
    We began with an in-depth analysis of the client's existing 16 databases, including their workloads, performance requirements, and application dependencies. Based on this analysis, we collaborated with hardware vendors to conduct a thorough Proof of Concept (POC), which led to our recommendation of a consolidation solution centered on the Oracle Database Appliance (ODA) and a meticulously crafted migration plan.

2.  **Modern Technical Architecture:**
    We designed a solution built on two all-flash **Oracle Database Appliance (ODA) X8-2** systems, leveraging the **Oracle 19c Multitenant (CDB/PDB)** architecture.
    - **ODA X8-2 Appliance:** As an engineered system optimized for the Oracle Database, the ODA delivers exceptional performance and reliability. Its high-density, all-flash design provided a powerful foundation for the consolidated database environment.
    - **Oracle 19c Multitenant Architecture:** This was the core technology for the consolidation. By "plugging" 16 individual Pluggable Databases (PDBs) into a single Container Database (CDB), we enabled resource sharing while maintaining effective isolation. This architecture dramatically simplifies management and significantly reduces Oracle licensing costs.

3.  **Professional and Seamless Migration:**
    Throughout the project lifecycle (April 2022 to November 2022), our expert team coordinated and ensured the smooth execution of the migration. We worked closely with the client's engineers to migrate, test, and launch all databases in carefully planned phases, guaranteeing a seamless business transition with zero impact on end-users.

The successful implementation of this modern architecture delivered tangible and strategic benefits across the organization.

### Project Outcomes

Through this successful database consolidation, Goodways helped the client achieve multi-faceted value:

- **Significant Cost Savings:** License consolidation via the multitenant architecture led to a sharp reduction in Oracle software fees. The server count dropped from over a dozen to just two ODAs, slashing hardware maintenance, power, and cooling costs.
- **Data Center Space Optimization:** The project freed up over 80% of the previously occupied rack space, creating room for future IT expansion.
- **Commitment to Green IT:** The substantial reduction in energy consumption helped the client lower its data center's carbon footprint, strongly supporting its Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) goals.
- **Enhanced Operational Efficiency:** Shifting from managing 16 separate databases to a single, unified platform greatly reduced the daily operational workload for the DBA team.
- **Improved Performance and Reliability:** Upgrading to the latest Oracle 19c long-term support release and high-performance all-flash ODA hardware ensures the stable and efficient operation of core business systems for years to come.
