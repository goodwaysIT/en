### Project Background
When multiple schemas, applications, or databases are hosted on target systems, hardware resource utilization can be improved through consolidation and compression, minimizing idle time cycles. Consequently, the same output can be achieved with fewer resources, thereby reducing costs.

### Project Objectives
The goals of compression and consolidation are: to classify and compress Oracle databases based on business criticality, database version, daily transaction volume, memory usage, database size, data synchronization, and disaster recovery requirements—all while ensuring controllable risks and leveraging resource utilization during off-peak hours.
The plan includes compressing and consolidating 3 sets of Oracle Exadata databases and 10 sets of PC server databases (primarily focusing on memory compression, with CPU and storage resources partially constrained). It is expected to reclaim 5 sets of PC servers.

### Project Work Description
The database compression and consolidation plan comprises three phases: Database Resource Compression, Database Migration, and PC Server Reclamation.  
Phase 1: Database Resource Compression  -- Evaluate existing and reclaimable database resources.  
Phase 2: Database Migration             -- Develop and execute a phased migration and consolidation plan based on Phase 1 evaluation results.  
Phase 3: PC Server Reclamation          -- Reclaim PC servers after database migration/consolidation completes and stable operation (≈1 month).  

### Project Implementation Status
Compression and consolidation work for 3 sets of Oracle Exadata databases and 10 sets of PC server databases has been completed (primarily memory compression; CPU and storage resources remain relatively sufficient). Expected to reclaim 5 sets of PC servers.
1.  **Resource compression for 3 sets of Exadata**
    -- Confirmed current resource usage on Exadata.
    -- Compressed databases eligible for consolidation on Exadata.
2.  **Resource compression for 5 PC servers**
    -- Confirmed current resource usage on PC servers.
    -- Compressed databases eligible for consolidation on PC servers.
3.  **Database migration and consolidation**
    -- Migration and consolidation from PC servers to Exadata databases.
    -- Migration and consolidation from PC servers to PC server databases.
4.  **PC server reclamation**
