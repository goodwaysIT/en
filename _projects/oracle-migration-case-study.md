## Client Overview

A financial services institution with mission-critical databases required an upgrade from Oracle Database 11g to 19c to take advantage of new features and ensure continued support. The client had strict requirements for zero downtime during the migration, as their systems serve customers 24/7.

## The Challenge

- Migrate multiple Oracle 11g databases (over 10TB total) to Oracle 19c
- Ensure zero downtime during the migration process
- Preserve all customizations and integrations
- Complete the migration within a tight timeline
- Validate data integrity throughout the process

## Our Solution

We implemented a comprehensive migration strategy using Oracle GoldenGate for zero-downtime migration:

### Phase 1: Assessment and Planning

- Conducted a thorough assessment of the existing environment
- Identified dependencies and potential challenges
- Created a detailed migration plan with risk mitigation strategies
- Set up a test environment to validate the migration approach

### Phase 2: Implementation

- Installed and configured Oracle GoldenGate on source and target systems
- Set up bidirectional replication between the source and target databases
- Implemented custom transformations to accommodate schema changes
- Conducted incremental testing throughout the implementation

### Phase 3: Cutover and Validation

- Performed a phased cutover of applications to the new environment
- Validated data integrity with automated comparison tools
- Monitored replication lag and performance metrics
- Provided 24/7 support during the cutover period

## Technologies Used

- Oracle Database 11g and 19c
- Oracle GoldenGate 19c
- Oracle Data Guard for backup and recovery
- Custom validation scripts for data integrity checks
- Performance monitoring tools

## Results

- **Zero Downtime**: Successful migration with no interruption to business operations
- **Performance Improvement**: 30% improvement in overall database performance
- **Cost Savings**: Reduced maintenance costs and improved resource utilization
