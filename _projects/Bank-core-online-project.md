# Bank Core System Launch Project  

## Project Background:  
In recent years, the operational environment of the banking industry has undergone transformative changes. Faced with evolving customer demands, banks need to shift from traditional **account-centric system architectures** to redesigning core business systems with a **customer-centric** approach. The increasing demand for financial product innovation requires banks to establish core business systems with **flexible architectures** and rapid product innovation capabilities to meet customers' needs for specialized financial services. To address cybersecurity threats, protect fund security, and enhance risk control capabilities, banks' business systems must standardize and centralize business processes to effectively manage operational risks. Building a new-generation core business system with advanced design concepts, accompanied by bank-wide **data centralization** and **process groups** during implementation, has become an essential path for commercial banks in China to enhance competitiveness through operational standardization and centralization.

## Project Objectives:  
Deliver **stress testing** and database deployment for the bank's new core database with the **highest quality**, ensuring the smooth launch of the new core database.

## Project Responsibilities:  
1.Assist in planning and testing **Oracle database** components for the new core project, including database **backup and recovery**, **performance tuning**, **log analysis**, **data migration**, and resolving critical/urgent issues.  
2.Assist in Oracle **database version implementation** and **test environment maintenance** during the new core project.  
3.Develop and implement database **backup/recovery strategies**, and monitor **high-availability environments** (replication, mirroring, load balancing) during the project.  
4.Optimize **data storage structures** based on business requirements; perform **database performance analysis/tuning** during the project.  
5.Conduct **pre-launch stress testing**, simulate failure scenarios, perform database performance analysis using test data, and provide actionable recommendations.

## Implementation Status:  
Compared to the legacy core system, the new-generation core business system demonstrates:   
1.**Enhanced reliability** and **large-data-volume processing capabilities**  
2.Optimized business processes, significantly improved **production efficiency** and **profitability**  
3.Flexible organizational structures, refined customer services, and rapid product customization meeting **business unit functionality**  
4.Achieved **system scalability** and **low maintenance costs** in the technical platform  
5.This system not only ensures current operations but also meets dynamic financial market demands, enabling the bank to swiftly adapt to future business development.
