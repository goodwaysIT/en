## Local Development & Getting Started

To run this Jekyll site locally, you'll need to have Ruby and Bundler installed. This site is built to be compatible with GitHub Pages.

### Prerequisites

*   **Ruby**: Version `3.3.4` (as per [GitHub Pages dependency versions](https://pages.github.com/versions/))
    *   We recommend using a Ruby version manager like `rbenv` or `rvm` to manage Ruby versions.
*   **Bundler**: A Ruby gem to manage project dependencies. Install it with `gem install bundler`.

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/goodwaysit/en.git
    cd en
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    Navigate to the `en` directory (or the root of your Jekyll project if it's structured differently) and run:
    ```bash
    bundle install
    ```
    This command will install Jekyll (version `3.10.0`) and other necessary gems as specified in the `Gemfile` and `Gemfile.lock`.

### Running the Site Locally

Once the dependencies are installed, you can serve the site locally:

```bash
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

By default, the site will be available at `http://localhost:4000`.
